    <p>Producing for half a decade and hailing from southwest Florida, FiLo creates bass music ranging from slow and deep, to heavy and weird. Having played shows with Ethereal Collective, and opening for acts like Zeke Beats and MontyCler, you’re sure to hear proper bass music and loads of unreleased music from him and his talented friends. He loves chopping acapella samples over his original music and every live set is unique and different. Growing up he was a multi-instrumentalist and after discovering bass music he has spent the last half a decade leveling up and finding his sound. From Wave, to dnb, to 140 bangers and electric funk his unique blend of styles creates a fun and entrancing atmosphere every time. With nearly one track release a month, you’re sure to find something from him that fits your style.</p><br>
